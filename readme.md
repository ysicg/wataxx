# wataxx

Ataxx is an abstract stategy board game, for which you can check the rules in its [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxx).


wataxx is an attempt at building a multiplayer website for the game. 

Its main goal is to serve its author as a gateway first project to web development.

## Disclaimer

So far I've been patching together bits of code to kick things off, with few/no regards to readability, modularity, performance etc.

Major refactoring will take place once I get a better overall idea of how things can be organized.
